## CONJUNCTIONS

removed items (subbord conjs) which are pre-verbal (which often have past tense inflection)
e.g. `go/gur`, `a/ar`, `nach/nár`
and which often follow (or attach to) a conjunction
e.g. `cé go`, `nuair nach`.
Remaining subordinating conjunctions can be followed by verb or copula:
`go mb'fhusa an obair ...`, `go dtógfadh sé`
e.g. `má bhíonn`, `más`.
Some still have tense marking as they are combined forms
e.g. `sula`, `sular`, `murar` etc.

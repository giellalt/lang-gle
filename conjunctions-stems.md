### CONJUNCTIONS
removed items (subbord conjs) which are pre-verbal (which often have past tense inflection)
e.g. go/gur a/ar nach/nár 
and which often follow (or attach to) a conjunction
e.g. cé go, nuair nach, 
remaining subordinating conjunctions can be followed by verb or copula 
go mb'fhusa an obair ..., go dtógfadh sé
e.g. má bhíonn, más
some still have tense marking as they are combined forms
e.g. sula, sular, murar etc.





gur NOT moved to Verb Part as a)always precede a verb b) have tense c) preceded by conjs like nuair, cé

# Grammar checker project

Targets:
- be able to correct seemingly easy errors missed by other tools (wrong forms on nouns after pronouns, determiners and prepositions)
- implement rules for the errors described in [córas ceartúcháin](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/sites/default/files/assets/document//Córas%20ceartúcháin_2018%20%281%29.pdf) (2017)
- improve speller based on the existing analyser, to work well with the grammar checker

Participants:
- **Seanán Ó Coistín**: driving force
- **Divvun persons**: grammar checker formalism and technical support

Timetable:
- this is a side project for all involved, so it will take time, potentially a lot of time

Communication:
- create new discussions [here](https://giella.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238946-gle) (log in using GitHub: click on the GitHub icon on the login page, scroll down if it isn't visible)

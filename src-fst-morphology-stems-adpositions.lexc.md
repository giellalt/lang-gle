Prepositions: 
Simple: le, ag, ar, etc.
Compound (Na Forainmneacha Réamhfhoclacha) Prepositional Pronouns (agam, agat...)
Emphatic Compound eg agamsa, uaimse, ...

theses are not preps only copula or conj
this "is" looks like "agus" to me ... removing the prep reading ...
should be subst except in Prep Cmpd - see below : maidir+Prep+Simp:maidir			#;
should be subst:  maille+Prep+Simp:maille			#; ! maille le = along with

le does not combine with art: but becomes leis before "an"

trí does not combine with art: but becomes tríd before "an"
